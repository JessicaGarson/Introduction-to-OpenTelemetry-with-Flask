# Introduction to OpenTelemetry with Flask
OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an open-source, vendor-neutral observability framework designed to work with any backend system. It provides standardized APIs, libraries, and tools to collect telemetry data, such as metrics, logs, and traces. This repository contains the code and resources accompanying a talk given at FlaskCon 2024.
